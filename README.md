# Imitation-based-DQN-ORBSLAM3

Imitation DQN aims to bring a supervised learned agent which can navigate in any indoor evironment using SLAM without having to face the tracking failures. 

We launch our training files as well as the pre-trained agent for the research community to test our agent and reuse the agent for further improvements.
